          <h2 class="Slide-title">Siting subsidized housing in Philadelphia, PA</h2>
          By Alexandra San Roman
          <p></p>
          Few decisions are more contentious than site selection for subsidized housing.
          No matter which side of the aisle, people have strong specifications for where
          they believe is the right location for subsidized housing.
          To guide the process more intentionally, each state devises a 'Qualified Action Plan' (QAP),
          which lists the priorities of state housing finance agency in funding projects.
          These QAPs have a scoring system, and those developments with a higher score
          have a higher likelihood of getting state funding.
          <p></p>
          To help improve the placement of subsidized housing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
          the following tool visualizes several aspects of neighborhood characteristics within the 2016-17
          <a href='https://www.novoco.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/pennsylvania_2017-2018_final_qap_2017.pdf'>Pennsylvania QAP</a>
           to assist developers in scoring themselves accurately, and swiftly. Developers can also use this tool
          to explore areas of opportunity throughout the City and determine the areas of highest need.

          <h2 class="Slide-title">Neighborhood Characteristics</h2>
          "The Qualified Action Plan considers many elements of a neighborhood when
          considering siting Affordable Housing. Poverty Rates, Homeownership Rates,
          and connections.
          Developments in neighborhoods with low poverty rates can receive 3 points.
          Developments in neighborhoods with high owner-occupied markets can receive 3 points.
          Developments that adhere to a neighborhood's community plan can receive 5 points."

        <div class="slide">
          <h2 class="Slide-title">Existing Affordable Housing Options</h2>
          "The QAP aims to site affordable housing in communities who do not already
          have a plethora of availability. A development can get 3 points for locating
          in a community with limited affordable housing options, both subsidized
          and non-subsidized.
          Additionally, a development can get 3 more points for limited affordable housing
          production in the past 20 years."

        <div class="slide">
          <h2 class="Slide-title">School Quality</h2>
          "The QAP aims to build new affordable housing in communities with strong
          neighborhood schools. Here, you can see that senior high schools with
          building level academic scores of >=70% can receive 1 point, while those with
          a score of >=80% can receive 2 points."

          "The QAP is looking to build new housing in transportation-accessible locations,
           defined by the state as within 1/2 mile of a transit stop. Site selection
           within this transit zone can receive 2 points."
