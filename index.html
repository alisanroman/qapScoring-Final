          By Alexandra San Roman
          <p></p>
          Few decisions are more contentious than site selection for subsidized housing.
          No matter which side of the aisle, people have strong specifications for where
          they believe is the right location for subsidized housing.
          To guide the process more intentionally, each state devises a 'Qualified Action Plan' (QAP),
          which lists the priorities of state housing finance agency in funding projects.
          These QAPs have a scoring system, and those developments with a higher score
          have a higher likelihood of getting state funding.
          <p></p>
          To help improve the placement of subsidized housing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
          the following tool visualizes several aspects of neighborhood characteristics within the 2016-17
          <a href='https://www.novoco.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/pennsylvania_2017-2018_final_qap_2017.pdf'>Pennsylvania QAP</a>
           to assist developers in scoring themselves accurately, and swiftly. Developers can also use this tool
          to explore areas of opportunity throughout the City and determine the areas of highest need.
